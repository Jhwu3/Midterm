	<p> 
	It happened an age ago. <br>
	But when I recall, I see it true.
	<br>
	<br>
	On a night of wint'ry fog.
	<br>
	<br>
	The rune of death was stolen <br>
	And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.<br>
	Queen Marika was driven to the brink.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why?<br>
	What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring?
	<br>
	<br>
	The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn. <br>
	And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.
	<br>
	<br>
	These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.<br>
	But there would be no victor.
	<br>
	<br>
	And so, we inhabit a fractured world.<br>
	Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.
	<br>
	<br>
	Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown? </p>
